      <h2>History</h2>
      <p class="back">
        The Chalukyas ruled Dharwad during the 12th century. A stone inscription
        indicates that there was a ruler by the name of BhaskaraDeva in 1117. In
        the 14th century, the district was first overrun by the Bahmani
        Sultanate, after which it was annexed to the newly established Hindu
        kingdom of Vijayanagar, an official of which named "Dharav", according
        to local tradition, built the fort at Dharwad town in 1403. After the
        defeat of the king of Vijayanagar at Talikot (1565), Dharwad was for a
        few years practically independent under its Hindu governor; but in 1573
        the fort was captured by the sultan of Bijapur, Adil Shah, and Dharwad
        was annexed to his dominions. Adil Shah built a fort in an area later
        called Manna Killa, and later Nazratabad. With this fort, the strategic
        importance of Dharwad increased and it attracted the attention of
        subsequent conquerors, including Aurangzeb, Shivaji, Aurangzeb's son
        Muhammad Muazzam known as Bahadur Shah I or Shah Alam, the seventh
        Mughal emperor (1707â€“1712), Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, Hyder Ali, Tipu
        Sultan and finally the British colonizers.[citation needed]

    <h2>Civic administration</h2>
    <p class="all">
      Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) was constituted in 1962 by
      combining two cities separated by a distance of 20 kilometers.[7][8] The
      area covered by the corporation is 213 km2 (82 sq mi)}, spread over 45
      revenue villages. The population of the city as per the 1991 census was 7
      lakhs. The population of Hubli-Dharwad is 943,857 according to 2011
      Census. There has been a huge demand by people of Dharwad to create a
      separate civic body and get itself detached by HDMC.Claims are that most
      of the funds are allocated to Hubli solely.[9]
